# Groovy NullPointerException Handling in Calculations

This example demonstrates a common issue in Groovy: unexpected behavior when performing calculations with potentially null values. The `calculate` function in `bug.groovy` shows a basic calculation with null value handling.  The solution in `bugSolution.groovy` uses the Elvis operator for a more concise and Groovy-idiomatic approach.

## Running the examples

Save the code samples as `bug.groovy` and `bugSolution.groovy` and execute them using the Groovy interpreter. You can compare the outputs to understand the behavior of the null handling.
